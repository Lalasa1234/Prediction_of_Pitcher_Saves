1. Repository Contents

*Notebooks*
Predicting_Saves
Objective: Scrapes data, processes it into clean, usable formats, and builds regression models to predict saves.
Processes:
Scraping URLs and parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup.
Data cleaning and organization into structured dataframes.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualizations.
Model creation, testing, and performance analysis, including error visualization.

Predicting_Saves_NOZEROS
Objective: Investigates methods for handling data seasons where pitchers recorded no saves.
Focus Areas:
Addressing whether to exclude seasons with zero saves or identify specific reasons behind these values.
Ensuring erroneous data from pitchers' final seasons is corrected or excluded to improve model accuracy.

2. Presentation
   
A concise project overview PDF for a 5-minute presentation. It summarizes the objectives, methodologies, results, and next steps.
Objective
Goal: Build a regression model to predict the number of saves a pitcher will earn based on previous performance metrics.

3. Approach
   
Feature Selection
Final model features include:
Opportunity Indicators: Games finished, appearances, saves, save opportunities, holds, team change, and two-year running sum of saves.
Performance Metrics: FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching), SO/BB (Strikeouts-to-Walks ratio), BB/9 (Walks per nine innings), H/9 (Hits per nine innings), ERA+ (Adjusted ERA), "mistakes" per game, and batters faced per game.
Demographic Factors: Age.

5. Modeling Techniques
   
Linear regression.
Ridge regression.
LASSO regression.
Feature scaling to optimize performance based on R¬≤ and MSE.

7. Data and Feature Engineering
   
*Data Source*
Data for over 300 pitchers spanning approximately 1,500 seasons was scraped from Baseball-Reference.
*Data Preparation*
Entire careers were analyzed, enabling exploration of time-series trends.
Features were evaluated using:
Correlation heatmaps.
Pairplots to avoid collinearity and identify relationships.
Interaction terms created in polynomial models.
LASSO cross-validation to streamline feature selection.
___

8. Results Summary
   
Final Model: LASSO regression.
Performance Metrics:
ùëÖ2 = 0.41
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 10.2 saves.
Interpretation: The model explains 41% of the variability in saves and predicts saves within an average error of 10.2 saves per season.

*Key Contributing Features*
***Opportunity Metrics***
Games finished.
Holds.
Saves.
Games.
***Dominance Metrics***
FIP.
SO/BB.
SO/9.

9. Next Steps
    
Improving Opportunity Metrics:
Investigate team and managerial trends in reliever usage and saves distribution.
Enhancing Dominance Metrics:
Incorporate advanced metrics such as:
Spin rate.
Velocity.
Swing-and-miss percentage.
Leverage external data sources to enrich the feature set.
Exploring Classification Models:
Transition from strict regression to a classification approach for pitcher roles (e.g., closer, setup man).
